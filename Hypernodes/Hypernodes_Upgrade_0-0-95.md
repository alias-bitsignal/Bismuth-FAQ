# Bismuth Hypernode: Upgrade to 0.0.95

See what's new: https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/blob/master/Hypernodes/HN_PreRelease_0-0-95.md

If it's a new install, see: https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/blob/master/Hypernodes/Hypernodes_Install_0-0-95.md

## What are the incidence on my rewards?

- If you follow the steps, you'll just get a few minutes down time, no impact
- At worst, say a full hours downtime, you'll just loose that hour (but others may, too, so same thing in the end)
- If you *don't* update, then you likely may fork and get stuck and get no more rewards.

## In a nutshell

- Stop HN
- Update code
- Run hn_check
- Restart regular node
- Install cronjob sentinel
- Check it works
