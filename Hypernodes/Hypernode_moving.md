# Moving a Hypernode

What to do when you move or migrate a Hypernode?

## The registration

The registration message links many things together:  
- The collateral Wallet (only one per HN allowed)
- The HN ip (only one per HN allowed)
- The HN PoS address (only one...)
- The reward address (can use the same on several HNs)

When you register via the helper page https://hypernodes.bismuth.live/?page_id=48 , you are supposed to save your reg and unreg url.

## Migrate a HN keeping all the same

Nothing to do, if all (including IP address) stays the same.

## Something changed

You have to unreg first using the unreg bis url.  

Unreg, wait for the transaction to be mined, rereg with the new parameters.


# Changing my reward address

Unreg, wait for the transaction to be mined, rereg with the new reward address.
